# Solidity to MultiversX Transpiler - Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementations

We have successfully implemented a Solidity to MultiversX transpiler with the following features:

### 1. Type Mapping
- Enhanced the `map_type` function to support more Solidity types and map them to appropriate MultiversX types
- Added support for complex types like mappings, arrays, and structs
- Improved error handling for unsupported types

### 2. Helper Functions
- Added support for error handling transformations
- Implemented functions for struct definitions
- Created event declaration transformations
- Added support for require/revert statement transformations

### 3. Rust AST Enhancements
- Extended the Rust AST to support more Solidity constructs
- Added support for custom error types
- Implemented more expression and statement types
- Enhanced code generation for MultiversX-compatible output

### 4. Test Cases
Created several test cases demonstrating the transpiler's capabilities:
- Simple storage contract
- ERC20 token implementation
- NFT marketplace with complex data structures and error handling

### 5. Documentation
- Created a comprehensive developer guide
- Added type mapping documentation
- Provided examples of Solidity to MultiversX transformations
- Included troubleshooting guidance

## Features Implemented
